# Flower Image Recognition
 
This is a program made in python to predict the type of flower in a PNG, JPEG, or other standard image file format. The program uses an open-source library IMAGEAI to train and predict the machine learning model. 

This was my WGU Capstone project that received an award Capstone Certificate of Excellence.
